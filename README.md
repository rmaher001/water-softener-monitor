# Water Softener Salt Monitor

Monitor your water softener salt level from Home Assistant. A distance sensor measures the salt level in your brine tank and reports the percentage full. Use Home Assistant automations to send notifications when salt is low, so you never run out.

**[Web Installer](https://rmaher001.github.io/water-softener-monitor/)** | Uses M5Stack ATOM Lite or S3 hardware with VL53L0X ToF sensor

## Hardware

**Controller (choose one):**
- **M5Stack ATOM Lite** (ESP32-PICO-D4) - ESP-IDF framework, web server enabled
  - [Official M5Stack Store](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit)
  - Also available at Mouser, DigiKey, Adafruit
- **M5Stack ATOM S3 Lite** (ESP32-S3) - Arduino framework, web server disabled
  - [Official M5Stack Store](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atoms3-lite-esp32s3-dev-kit)
  - Also available at Mouser, DigiKey, Adafruit

**Sensor:**
- **M5Stack ToF Sensor Unit** (VL53L0X, 0-200cm range)
  - [Official M5Stack Store](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/tof-sensor-unit)
  - Also available at Mouser, DigiKey, Adafruit
  - Includes 20cm Grove cable

**Power:**
- Long USB-C cable for power

## Physical Installation

1. **Sensor mounting**: Attach M5Stack ToF sensor unit to underside of tank lid using 3M Velcro or double-sided foam tape
2. **Cable routing**: Drill 8-10mm hole in lid, install rubber grommet, route Grove cable through
3. **Controller mounting**: Attach ATOM to top of tank lid using 3M Velcro strips
4. **Power**: Connect long USB-C cable to ATOM (disconnect when refilling tank)

**Note**: The M5Stack ToF sensor comes in a plastic case - Velcro/foam tape mounting works best and avoids drilling into the unit.

## Installation

### Quick Start - Web Installer (Recommended!)

Flash firmware directly from your browser - no software installation required:

**ðŸ‘‰ [Open Web Installer](https://rmaher001.github.io/water-softener-monitor/)**

**Setup Process:**
1. Connect your ATOM device via USB-C
2. Choose your hardware (ATOM Lite or ATOM S3)
3. Flash the firmware using the web installer
4. Configure WiFi using Home Assistant app
5. Device auto-discovers in Home Assistant

---

### Optional: ESPHome Dashboard Management

For advanced management and customization:

1. **Adopt in ESPHome Dashboard** - Device appears automatically, click "Adopt"
2. **Customize Configuration** - Edit YAML to add custom features
3. **OTA Updates** - Deploy changes wirelessly after adoption

**Note**: It appears that some of the devices may not receive update notifications in Home Assistant if they are not adopted in ESPHome Dashboard.

### Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

**For Development/Testing:**

1. Clone this repository
2. Update `/Users/yourusername/esphome/secrets.yaml` with your WiFi credentials:
   ```yaml
   wifi_ssid: "YourWiFiSSID"
   wifi_password: "YourWiFiPassword"
   ```
3. Flash the development config for your hardware:
   ```bash
   # For ATOM Lite
   esphome run src/water-softener-lite-dev.yaml --device /dev/ttyUSB0

   # For ATOM S3
   esphome run src/water-softener-s3-dev.yaml --device /dev/ttyUSB0
   ```

**Note**: The web installer approach is recommended for most users as it handles encryption and configuration automatically through ESPHome Dashboard adoption.

## Configuration

All parameters adjustable in Home Assistant (no reflashing needed):

- **Tank Height**: Total internal tank height in cm
- **Full Level Distance**: Distance from sensor to "full" salt level
- **Update Interval**: How often to poll the sensor (1-300 seconds)
- **Thresholds**: Full, Good, Low, Critical alert levels (percentages)

**Note**: ATOM Lite also includes a web interface at http://water-softener-monitor.local for standalone configuration.

## Status Levels

- **Full**: â‰¥75% (default)
- **Good**: â‰¥50% (default)
- **Low**: â‰¥25% (default)
- **Critical**: <10% (default)

## Integration

- **Home Assistant**: Auto-discovery with ESPHome integration (no API key required after adoption)
- **Web Interface**: Available on ATOM Lite only (http://water-softener-monitor.local)
- **OTA Updates**: Supported through ESPHome Dashboard (no password required after adoption)
- **Bluetooth**: Improv BLE for easy WiFi configuration
